/** 
 * @brief Resizes an image.
 * The function resize resizes the image src down to or up to the specified size. Note that the
 * initial dst type or size are not taken into account. Instead, the size and type are derived from
 * the `src`,`dsize`,`fx`, and `fy`. If you want to resize src so that it fits the pre-created dst,
 * you may call the function as follows:
 * @param[in] src input image, supported image type:Mat, the number of channel: 1, 3, 4.
 * @param[out] dst output image; it has the size dsize (when it is non-zero) or the size computed from
 * src.size(), fx, and fy; the type of dst is the same as of src.
 * @param[in] dsize output image size; if it equals zero, it is computed as: {dsize = Size(round(fx*src.cols), round(fy*src.rows))}.
 * Either dsize or both fx and fy must be non-zero.
 * @param[in] fx scale factor along the horizontal axis; when it equals 0, it is computed as {(double)dsize.width/src.cols}.
 * @param[in] fy scale factor along the vertical axis; when it equals 0, it is computed as {(double)dsize.height/src.rows}.
 * @param[in] interpolation interpolation method, see #InterpolationType.
