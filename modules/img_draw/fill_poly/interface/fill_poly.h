/** 
 * @brief Fills the area bounded by one or more polygons.
 * The function cv::fillPoly fills an area bounded by several polygonal contours.
 * The function can fill complex areas, for example, areas with holes, contours
 * with self-intersections (some of their parts), and so forth.
 * @param[inout] img Image only support PKG_BGR_U8 or PKG_RGB_U8 format now.
 * @param[in] pts Array of polygons where each polygon is represented as an array of points.
 * @param[in] npts Array of each polygons pts data.
 * @param[in] ncontours All Polygon number.
 * @param[in] color Polygon color.
 * @param[in] line_type Type of the polygon boundaries. See #line_types
 * @param[in] shift Number of fractional bits in the vertex coordinates.
 * @param[in] offset Optional offset of all points of the contours.
