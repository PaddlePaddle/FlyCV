 * @brief Draws a line segment connecting two points.

 * used. Thick lines are drawn with rounding endings. Antialiased lines are drawn using Gaussian filtering.

 * @param[in] pt2 Second point of the line segment.
 * @param[in] color Line color.
 * @param[in] thickness Line thickness.
 * @param[in] line_type Type of the line. See #line_types.
 * @param[in] shift Number of fractional bits in the point coordinates.
