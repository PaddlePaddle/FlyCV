FlyCV is a high-performance library for processing computer visual tasks. We are currently doing a lot of optimization on the arm side，and at the same time, we are also starting optimization work on other CPU platforms，heterogeneous computing platforms. Compared to other image processing libraries, it provides us with more fine-grained compilation options and is lighter in size.

## Documention

### API Documention
To make it easier for everyone, our interface design is close to OpenCV. Howerver, there are some differences between the two.
<br>
Just see the interface documentation for more details: [API Documention](./)

### How to compile from source
We support most major operating systems, including android, armlinux, macos(x86 & arm), windows, ios. 
<br>
You can compile from source by following the documentation below.
